# Python-APIs:

This project was designed to create a script to visualize the weather of 500 plus cities thorough the World utilizing Python, and the OpenWeatherMap API. 
While randomly selecting 500 unique cities utilizing citypy and analyzing the weather with the OpenWeatherMap API, I was able to notice interesting relationships between four dependent variables such as Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed; with an independent variable such as Latitude. 

The plots will show the following relationship:

•	Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

•	Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

•	Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

•	Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
